# LunchOrderApp
App development test for HealthLogix.

# Screens
1. Welcome Screen
The App starts with a splash screen displaying a logo and name of the App. The Logo asset was made possible using Canva.

2. Order Status Screen
Order Status screen displays a list of items that can be ordered. This list of items is hard coded using the 'list' data type and can be found inside the food_item.dart file.

Images for the items are loaded over the Internet from various websites. This reduces the performances drastically and causes the app to be laggy but for a quick hack seems to work fine.
